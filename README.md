	- percentage of time elapsed in the week : month : year
	- search (see below for commands)
	- sunrise/sunset info
	- progress in the year on the left and day on the right

#### Contributions

This project is heavily inspired by Cade Scroggins' excellent [tilde](https://github.com/cadejscroggins/tilde). I also use [SunCalc](https://github.com/mourner/suncalc) for calculating sunrise/sunset times.
